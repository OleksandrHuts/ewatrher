As a successful and respected solo artist, Brian’s recordings include the albums Back to the Light (1992), featuring Too Much Love Will Kill You and Driven By You, both Ivor Novello Award-winners, and 1998’s Another World. His songs continue to influence new generations of performers and have inspired recordings by artists as diverse as Elton John, Def Leppard, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Shirley Bassey and Eminem. Brian has enjoyed collaborations with numerous artists including Robbie Williams, the Foo Fighters, Cliff Richard, Guns ‘n’ Roses, Diana Ross and Luciano Pavarotti. He was also proud to play feature guitar on the Winter Olympics 2002 opening music, The Fire Within for his friend and composer, the late Michael Kamen.", "Perhaps the most memorable display of Brian’s unique style and musicianship was his performance of his own arrangement of God Save the Queen, live from the roof of Buckingham Palace, to open HM The Queen’s 2002 Golden Jubilee celebrations in front of an audience of more than 200 million people around the world.", "An interest in film scoring developed when Queen became the first rock group to score a major film, Flash Gordon, featuring the hit Flash! penned by Brian. This was followed by definitive music for Highlander. Brian later contributed a mini-opera for Steve Baron’s 1996 Pinocchio, and composed a complete film soundtrack for the 1999 French art film Furia.", "May is, of course, no stranger to the theatrical world, frequently contributing to the live performance work of his wife Anita Dobson, but in 1987, entering this world in his own right, he wrote and performed the music for the London Riverside Studios production of Macbeth. He returned at full strength to the Theatre in 2002, as one of the principal creative forces behind the groundbreaking ‘rock theatrical’, We Will Rock You, which became phenomenally successful, and was one of London’s top-selling shows running for 12 years with nightly standing ovations at the Dominion Theatre, London, it was easily the longest- running show ever to play at the theatre. Although We Will Rock You is now a global enterprise, Brian remains personally involved in developing new productions and updating those currently playing.", "On Freddie’s death, the surviving members of Queen set up a charity to support AIDS relief, the Mercury Phoenix Trust. The MPT has to date channelled more than $16 million to over 800 AIDS projects around the world. An ongoing commitment to AIDS awareness led Queen to become a driving force in the 46664 campaign for the Nelson Mandela Foundation. The first of a series of 46664 concerts, held in Cape Town in November 2003, was broadcast worldwide via TV, Internet and radio, becoming the most widely distributed media event in history, with an audience of over 2 billion in 166 countries. Brian continues in his role as an ambassador and participant in the 46664 international concert series aimed at promoting AIDS awareness worldwide.", "Queen’s musical catalogue consistently tops popularity polls, and their achievements have been recognised with numerous prestigious awards, including being honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (October 2002), being inducted into both the USA Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (March 2001) and the Songwriters Hall of Fame (June 2003), and being among the first inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame (November 2004), which was the first event at which Paul Rodgers joined Brian and Roger as vocalist. A successful world tour together followed in 2005/06, and Paul, Brian and Roger (Taylor) then went into the studio to create new material for the well-received Queen/Paul Rodgers album The Cosmos Rocks, followed by a second giant world tour.", "In July 2005, Guinness World Records announced that Queen had overtaken the Beatles to become the most successful albums act in UK chart history.", "Brian’s further credits are too numerous to list, but they include designing a Planetarium show currently showing in Germany and Belgium; re-mixing classic Queen recordings in 5.1 Surround Sound; writing themes for several TV shows; producing a number 1 hit, The Stonk, for Comic Relief’s Red Nose Day; as well as lending his inspirational skills to the three top-selling volumes of The Best Air Guitar Album in the World...Ever!", "Retaining his keen interest in astronomy, Brian is a regular contributor to The Sky at Night for his long-time friend, Sir Patrick Moore, with whom he co-authored, along with Dr Chris Lintott, an illustrated astrophysics book entitled BANG! The Complete History of the Universe. First published in 2006, it has since been published in 20 languages, and is currently in its third updated edition. Brian followed up with a unique book on another of his long-term passions, seminal 1850s photographer T. R. Williams whose work Brian has been researching for over 30 years. The book, “A Village Lost and Found”, written with photohistorian Elena Vidal, is illustrated in 3-D, and includes a patent stereoscope of Brian’s own design.", "In December 2005, Brian was honoured with a CBE, Commander of the Order of the British Empire, by HM The Queen, in recognition of his services to music.", "In 2007, after a 30-year break pursuing his musical career, Brian returned to Imperial College, London, to sign up to complete his Doctoral Thesis in Astrophysics, and after one year, successfully submitted the new version of his thesis on Interplanetary Dust.", "Already the holder of honorary degrees from the Universities of Hertfordshire, Exeter and John Moore’s, Liverpool, Brian in 2007 finally achieved the award of a full PhD degree. Brian subsequently accepted a post of Visiting Researcher at Imperial College and will be continuing his work in astronomy. He is also currently the Chancellor or Liverpool John Moore’s University.", "In 2010 Brian founded Save-Me, a campaign devoted to preventing cruelty to wild animals. His work fighting the abuse of foxes and badgers led to him recently being awarded the honour of “Campaigner of the Year” by IFAW, the International fund for Animal Welfare. This work continues through the Save-Me website www.Save-Me.org.uk.", "Brian has continued to work outside of the Queen mothership with West End singer Kerry Ellis and together they have released three well received albums and toured successfully across Europe.", "Brian is also the owner of the London Stereoscopic Company and continues his interest in astronomy."]

			"info": ["The life of Farrokh Bulsara began on the East African island of Zanzibar on September 5, 1946. 25 years later in London under the name of Freddie Mercury he was fronting the now legendary rock group named Queen.", "The son of Bomi and Jer Bulsara, Freddie spent the bulk of his childhood in India where he attended St. Peter’s boarding school. He began taking piano lessons at the age of seven. No one could foresee where a love of music would take him.", "The Bulsara family moved to Middlesex in 1964 and from there Freddie joined up with a blues band called Wreckage while studying graphic design courses at Ealing College of Art. While singing for Wreckage, a fellow student introduced Freddie to Roger Taylor and Brian May, founder members of a band called Smile. Smile metamorphosed into Queen when Freddie joined Roger and Brian as the lead vocalist. The final member of the band, which was to stay together for the next 20 years, was bassist John Deacon, who joined the band on 1st of March 1971.", "The rest is rock history. EMI Records and Elektra Records signed the band and in 1973 their debut album Queen was released and hailed as one of the most exciting developments ever in rock music.", "The immortal operatically styled single Bohemian Rhapsody was released in 1975 and proceeded to the top of the UK charts for 9 weeks. A song that was nearly never released due to its length and unusual style but which Freddie insisted would be played became the instantly recognisable hit. By this time Freddie’s unique talents were becoming clear, a voice with a remarkable range and a stage presence that gave Queen its colourful, unpredictable and flamboyant personality.", "Very soon Queen’s popularity extended beyond the shores of the UK as they charted and triumphed around Europe, Japan and the USA where in 1979 they topped the charts with Freddie’s song Crazy Little thing Called Love.", "Queen was always indisputably run as a democratic organisation. All four members are each responsible for having penned number one singles for the band. This massive writing strength combined with spectacular lights, the faultless sound, a sprinkling of theatricality and Freddie’s balletic movements made up Queen on stage and on film.", "Through Freddie’s ability to project himself and the band’s music and image to the four corners of 70,000 seater venues they became known as the prime developers of stadium rock, a reputation perpetuated by their pioneering tactics in South America where in 1981 they performed to 231,000 fans in Sao Paulo, a world record at the time. They also became known as the key innovators of pop videos as their catalogue of 3-minute clips became more and more adventurous in style, size and content.", "Their phenomenal success continued around the globe throughout the 80’s highlighted in 1985 by their show-stealing and unforgettable performance on stage at Live Aid.", "In the mid 80’s, Freddie started concentrating on his solo career, which was to run in tandem with Queen (“the mothership”) for several albums commencing with the 1985 release of Mr. Bad Guy. Freddie’s much loved sense of self-parody reached a zenith with his cover version of The Platter’s song The Great Pretender in 1987, the video of which recorded him descending a sweeping staircase among acres of identical cardboard cutouts of himself.", "His first major collaboration outside of Queen was with Dave Clark for the recording of London’s West End musical Time, in 1986. This was followed in 1987 with the realisation of one of Freddie’s long-term dreams; to record with the world revered opera diva Montserrat Caballé. The LP’s title song, Barcelona went on to become an anthem for Senora Caballé’s home city and the theme for the Olympics in 1992.","While most publicly recognised as the front man to one of the most progressive rock bands of the 70’s, Freddie defied the stereotype. A taste for venturing into new territories – a trait that was to have a marked influence on the direction Queen would take – took Freddie to explore his interests in a wide spectrum of the arts, particularly in the areas of ballet, opera and theatre, even taking a participating role: in October 1977 the sell-out audience of a charity gala at the London Coliseum organised by Royal Ballet Principal dance Wayne Eagling received the surprise of an unannounced appearance by a silver-sequinned leotard-clad Freddie performing an intricate routine choreographed for him by Eagling. In 1987 he made a one-night appearance in Dave Clarke’s Time at the Dominion Theatre, although legend has it Freddie occasionally turned up at the theatre to support friend Clarke’s musical, one night selling ice-creams in the stalls! Freddie would have loved the fact that The Dominion played host to the band’s phenomenally successful musical We Will Rock You which ran for 12 years.", "Freddie returned to the studios to record Innuendo with Queen in 1990.", "On November 24th, 1991, Freddie’s struggle against AIDS ended when he passed away just over 24 hours after he had publicly announced he had the disease. Musicians and fans from all over the world paid their highest respects as the passing of rock’s most innovative, flamboyant ambassador signified the end of an era at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium on April 20, 1992 which gave birth to the Mercury Phoenix Trust, the AIDS charity set up in Freddie’s memory by the remaining members of Queen and Freddie’s Executor, Jim Beach.", "Freddie Mercury, who majored in stardom while giving new meaning to the word showmanship, left a legacy of songs, which will never lose their stature as classics to live on forever. Some of the most poignant of these were immortalised on the Queen album Made In Heaven released in November 1995. The sleeve of the album shows a view from Freddie’s Montreux home.", "Despite twenty years having passed since Freddie lost his life to HIV complications, he remains in the minds of millions throughout the world as one of the greatest artists we will ever see. In September 2010 (coincidentally, around Freddie’s 64th birthday) a poll carried out among rock fans saw him named the Greatest Rock Legend Of All Time, beating Elvis Presley to claim the title, and ahead of David Bowie, Jon Bon Jovi, Jimi Hendrix and Ozzy Osbourne.", "A spokesman for OnePoll.com which conducted the poll said: “Freddie Mercury had it all, the voice, the image, the stage presence, everything.“","“He combined his ear for music with an ability to deliver to stadium audiences and as such millions were devastated when HIV killed him in 1991. His legend will live on forever.” (OnePoll.Com. September 6, 2010)", "September 5, 2010 saw The Mercury Phoenix Trust launch Freddie For A Day, a major annual initiative designed to celebrate Freddie’s life each year on his birthday and to support the on-going work of the Trust. The project encourages fans to dress as Freddie for a day and in doing so raise funds for MPT through sponsorship. No one could have imagined the extraordinary response which resulted, with fans from 24 countries around the world, from Argentina to Ukraine, seizing on the idea to pay their own special tribute to Freddie.", "Some sent pictures strutting their stuff at home, singing into a microphone in their bedroom. Others took the plunge and spent the whole day as Freddie, including one US enthusiast who dressed herself as I’m Going Slightly Mad Freddie and then spent her day at the local mall and then at Columbus Zoo in Ohio with a penguin and a gorilla. Another took a TGV trip from France to Switzerland dressed in a harlequin leotard. The stories of extraordinary and fun days spent come in their hundreds, and as a result, Freddie For A Day is now an annual event.", "Freddie Mercury’s life continues to be celebrated each year through a Mercury Phoenix Trust produced Official Fan Party that is held on his birthday and held in his honour in Montreux, Switzerland." ]

			"info": ["Although best known for his powerhouse role in Queen, Roger Taylor is anything but a drummer confined to his kit. With rock n’roll in his veins all through his schooldays, he has always been a highly active, vocal member of Queen. He famously wrote Queen’s landmark hits Radio Ga Ga and A Kind Of Magic, and was also the first to make a solo album, 1981’s Fun In Space. To date he has released 5 solo albums, which, aside from his work with Queen, further highlighted Taylor as an musician and writer with a strong sense of identity, a wide musical perspective, and - not least of all - a man not without a sense of irony. Just consider, for instance, the lyrics to I’m In Love With My Car, his B side to Bohemian Rhapsody, and a firm audience favourite in the Queen live set.", "Taylor’s active approach has not been confined to his music: when media mogul Rupert Murdoch made attempts to buy Manchester United football club, Taylor funded the club supporters in their attempts to block the sale, and historically helped them succeed.", "His history in one of rock’s most famous bands begins in the late 60’s, the time when he first teamed up with Brian May, and later John Deacon and Freddie Mercury, to form Queen. But before that...", "Roger Taylor was born in Kings Lynn, Norfolk, on July 26th 1949, Roger became fascinated with music in the early 50s, when his family moved to Cornwall. He learned his first instrument, the ukulele, at a tender age, and enjoyed a brief taste of things to come in a pre-teen skiffle band whose collective talent survived just two public performances, both apparently excruciating!", "His music took on a different direction in 1960, when he became a rather reluctant member of the Truro Cathedral Choir -- a prerequisite of his scholarship. He taught himself the guitar around this time, but by the following year had moved over to drums.", "By 1966 Roger had not only progressed to drumming in Cornwall's most popular band, the Reaction, but had also become their lead singer, with his drum kit placed -- where else? -- in the principal position, at the front of the stage. That year, the Reaction won a hotly- contested local talent contest and, according to newspaper reports, were duly “mobbed by young girls“.", "While maintaining his keen interest in music, Roger decided to study dentistry, and in 1967 moved to London to enrol at the London Hospital Medical College. He later studied biology, obtaining a BSc in the subject.", "In 1968 Roger formed another group, Smile, with Middlesex guitar ace Brian May. Smile played sporadically over the next few years and even issued a single in the United States. By 1971, Roger had long abandoned any desire to become a dentist or a biologist, and with new additions to the line-up John Deacon and Freddie Mercury, Smile became known as Queen.", "The Queen legend often refers to how Taylor and Mercury were particularly close, and spent many hours on the town together seeing bands who at that time were their heroes: The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, The Who, all of whom influenced them and helped shape the musical destiny of Queen.", "Roger began writing songs for Queen from day one, and each of the band's fifteen studio albums included at least one of his compositions. History notes that all four members of Queen wrote No.1 singles: Taylor dutifully provided his with Radio Ga Ga , A Kind Of Magic and These Are The Days Of Our Lives amongst his.", "1977 was the landmark year in which Queen released We Are The Champions and We Will Rock You. Roger bought a Ferrari, and became the first member of Queen to launch a solo career with the release of the single I Wanna Testify.", "His solo album Fun In Space followed in 1981, and was succeeded by 1984's rock-based Strange Frontier. Both LPs reached the Top 30. In 1987 Roger formed his own band The Cross, in which after more than 20 years he finally resumed the role of lead singer. The Cross released three distinctive albums and toured extensively in the UK and Europe.", "After the tragic death of Freddie Mercury, Roger returned to his solo career with 1994's Happiness?, an album on which he explored the theme of “dealing with life and looking for happiness“. The success of the album prompted further tours of the UK and Italy. Then came perhaps his most potent album, Electric Fire, which clearly showed Taylor as an acute observational songwriter. Rich in contemporary reflections on life, the album was full of attention-grabbing songs tackling thought-provoking and sometimes challenging issues — national obsolescence, domestic violence, and poverty, among them. One track, People On Streets, was inspired by visits Roger made to India and the inequalities he witnessed in the fortunes of that country's vast population. Never shy to express himself, several super- rich and powerful world figures get name checked in the song.", "That the Queen musical We Will Rock You came into being could be seen as something of a surprise taking into account Roger’s openly expressed view that “musicals are completely foreign to me. It’s a genre I don’t particularly like.” But after working closely with Brian and writer Ben Elton on shaping the musical, Taylor found himself deeply entrenched in developing the show, breaking the rules of musical theatre and taking on the role – along with Brian - as musical supervisor, not only for the first production in London, but for each of the subsequent productions throughout the world. To date, local productions of the show have reached 8 further countries.", "At the same time as setting up We Will Rock You, Roger and Brian played a central part in the formation of the Nelson Mandela 46664 charity, performing at the first two South Africa concerts, and providing several new songs to the 46664 album which saw them collaborate with the likes of Bono, Anastacia, Dave Stewart and Beyonce. Roger penned two new songs for the project, Say It’s Not True, a song about finding out you’re HIV positive, and Invincible Hope, based on the writings of Nelson Mandela and actually featuring the voice of Mandela reading phases from his autobiography.", "In 2005, after an accidental encounter with former Free singer Paul Rodgers, Roger and Brian felt the time was right to put Queen back on the road. Billed as Queen + Paul Rodgers, Roger and Brian tested the water with a handpicked set of European dates. Such was the momentum built up over the six week European tour, a US tour was booked to follow, which saw Roger and Brian return to the USA to play for the first time in more than 20 years. The impact of the return to the road was summed up in a review of is closing night in Vancouver: “the night that arena rock officially made its comeback”.", "Roger returned to his solo career in late 2009 with the release of the single The Unblinking Eye. A new solo album emerged in 2013, the critically acclaimed Fun On Earth, plus a comprehensive box set called The Lot which covered all his solo material and work with The Cross.", "Roger also oversees and produces The Queen Extravaganza, the official Queen Tribute act. The Queen Extravaganza is a spectacular touring concert show designed to take the music and live experience of Queen and bring it to generations of fans.", "With Queen + Adam Lambert’s planned blockbuster 2020 Rhapsody European tour postponed until 2022 by the Covid-19 pandemic, Roger made good use of his lengthy lay-off. Fired up with creative inspiration, he spent much of lockdown writing and recording new material. Before long he found himself with his first solo album in eight years, Outsider,", "In a tradition dating back to his very first solo album, Fun in Space from 1981, he wrote, produced, sang and performed all the songs on Outsider himself, with just a little help from long-time friends and collaborators. Building on more than half a century in music, Roger conceived Outsider as a kind of mature late-career statement, its prevailing mood autumnal and bittersweet. “Autumnal is a very good word for it,” he says. “It's slightly nostalgic and wistful, and quite adult, a bit more grown-up than my last couple of albums.”", "Launching Outsider in grand style, Roger - with a hastily assembled band of his regular musician partners – Queen + Adam Lambert’s keyboard player Spike Edney, supporting drummer Tyler Warren, and bassist Neil Fairclough - and a couple of new recruits – guitarist Christian Mendoza and keyboard player Tina Keys - took to the road to play a 14-date tour of the UK promising a set list of solo career tracks old and new, plus some crowd-pleasing Queen classics, news that was music to the ears for the rock starved masses as they finally emerged from lockdown hibernation.","Opening in Newcastle October 2 with a final show at London’s O2 Shepherds Bush Empire on October 22 the tour played to packed houses and universally ecstatic reviews: “Quite simply brilliant“. “Do yourself a favour. See this tour“. “A phenomenal show“, “a hugely enjoyable rock romp”.", "Meanwhile, his Outsider album, release October 1, rounded off 2021 on a triumphant note for Roger. His sixth solo album, it debuted at No.3 in the UK chart, his highest-ever placing outside Queen", "The summer of 2022 finally saw the twice-delayed Queen + Adam Lambert Rhapsody Tour reinstated, with Roger, Brian May and Adam Lambert playing 36 sold out shows across Europe between May and end of July, not forgetting one additional triumphant by-special-invitation appearance on June 4, 2022 – performing for the opening of the historic Platinum Party Buckingham Palace concert celebrating Her Majesty The Queen’s seventy-year reign."]

			"info": ["John Deacon’s first guitar was a red plastic Tommy Steele special, which his parents bought for him when he was seven.", "John’s father, Arthur, however, led him in a different direction, encouraging John to tinker with electronics, a hobby that Arthur himself loved. One of John's early projects included adapting an old reel-to-reel tape deck to record music from the radio - usually The Beatles and Alan Freeman's Hit Parade. John’s interest in electronics developed into a passion, and in his younger years at least, he thought of turning his hobby into a career.", "But side by side with his interest in electronics, John's interest in music was also growing, particularly triggered when he bought The Beatles first two albums. Becoming a huge fan of the band, John took the decision to learn how to play the guitar. Diligently saving the money from his early morning paper round, John was able to buy a ‘proper’ guitar. He then threw himself into practising, and was soon jamming in a friend's garage. By the age of fourteen John was well practised enough to form his first band, The Opposition.", "Over the next few years, The Opposition went through numerous line-up changes and played many gigs. By the end of 1966, the band had a strong following throughout John’s home turf of Leicester. But when, later that year, the Opposition's bassist left the band, it fell to John to fill the gap. So, he bought his first bass guitar, an Eko, for £22, and with the change of line-up, the band changed their name to The New Opposition, with John now playing the bass.", "Several band name changes later (they were now called Art), 1969 saw John leaving the band for London, taking up studies in electronics at Chelsea College, University of London. For the moment, music took second place to electronics, but John had of course brought along his old acoustic guitar just in case an opportunity came up. John went on to achieve a First Class Honours Degree in Electronics that same year.", "In October of 1970, John went to see a performance by a new band called Queen. He recalls, ", "“They were all dressed in black, and the lights were very dim too, so all I could see were four shadowy figures. They didn't make a lasting impression on me at the time.”", "But several months later, in early 1971, John again encountered Queen, when he was introduced to Brian May and Roger Taylor. For their part, they had not been impressed by the bass players they’d encountered and had just lost their seventh. They asked John if he was interested in auditioning and days later John found himself at a lecture hall at Imperial College where the band was rehearsing. He brought along his trusty bass guitar and his own custom- adapted amp, now known as the legendary ‘Deacy Amp’. He began to learn Son And Daughter and a few other songs the group had been playing. Not long after, on 1 March 1971, John Richard Deacon became the fourth and final member of Queen, largely, as history recounts it, not only because he was a brilliant bass player, but he was also quiet and didn’t try to upstage the others, particularly the band’s lead singer, the very larger than life Freddie Mercury. At just 19, John was the youngest member to join the band.", "That home-made amp, the ‘Deacy’, which helped John take his place in Queen and is also now used by Brian May, is shortly to become commercially available. John’s image as ‘the quiet one’ in Queen extended to their early recording sessions, in London, which focused on songs written by Freddie, Brian and Roger. John’s standing as the ‘invisible man’ of the group was humorously marked by the band on their first album, Queen, where they changed his name in the sleeve credits to Deacon John, rather than the other way around, to “make him sound more interesting”. This returned to normal for Queen II.", "It wasn’t until the band’s third album, Sheer Heart Attack, that John’s first composition for Queen appeared, with the rather catchy Misfire. More of a Pop/Motown kind of guy - strangely at odds with Brian and Roger’s rock roots and Freddie’s grand musical landscapes - John’s writing skills flourished in the recording sessions which followed. He would go on to compose some of Queen’s biggest and most popular hits including You’re My Best Friend, I Want To Break Free’ and Another One Bites the Dust, propelling Queen’s career to new heights in the US, topping the charts for three weeks and being voted the Favourite Single in the Pop/Rock category at the American Music Awards in 1981. The Another One Bites the Dust single was such a hit right across the board that it even found an audience on the black audience radio stations, reaching No. 2 in the national R & B charts. Along with We Are The Champions and We Will Rock You, the song has passed into legend by becoming Queen’s third major sports anthem.", "John took a brief foray into solo work when in 1986 he formed The Immortals, and released one single, No Turning Back, and contributing to the original soundtrack of the film Biggles, based on the Royal Flying Corps pilot character in the series of novels written by Captain W.E. Johns.", "Today John lives a life retired from Queen but still takes an interest in the continuance of the legacy of the band, and remains in contact with former bandmates, Roger Taylor and Brian May.", "John’s last appearance on stage with Queen was at the Paris National Théâtre de Chailioton 17 January 1997 at the Gala premiere of Maurice Béjart’s AIDS-inspired Ballet for Life, dedicated to Freddie Mercury and dancer, Jorge Donn, performing The Show Must Go On with Elton John joining the band on vocals.", "John joined his former bandmates for one final time in October 1997 for the recording of the Brian May song, No-One But You (Only The Good Die Young), released by Queen as a personal tribute to the late Freddie Mercury." ]

They made their first US tour, and in November released Sheer Heart Attack which was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic.", "1975 saw their new release, A Night At The Opera, and – significantly – the single Bohemian Rhapsody. At 5’ 55” it should have been too long for successful radio play but it became one of the greatest singles of all time, staying at No. 1 in the UK chart for nine weeks.

They were also approached to write the score for a forthcoming feature film, Flash Gordon. Before that they released The Game in 1980 which went five times platinum in Canada alone! Another One Bites The Dust became the band’s biggest selling American single. Later that year the soundtrack for Flash Gordon was released and by the end of the year Queen had sold over 45,000,000 albums worldwide.", "In 1981 they toured the Far East and were the first band to make a stadium tour of South America. They played to 131,000 people in Sao Paolo, the largest paying audience for any band anywhere in the world. Greatest Hits, Greatest Flix and Greatest Pix were released simultaneously later in the year and Greatest Hits has rarely been out of the UK album charts since. Greatest Flix was the first collection of promo-videos released commercially by any band. Next year saw the release of the band’s twelfth album, Hot Space whilst they were in the middle of a European tour.", "1984 saw The Works and the single Radio Ga Ga became a worldwide hit, reaching No. 1 in 19 countries. Another huge hit was I Want To Break Free, featuring one of their most famous videos, all dressed in drag. In 1985 they were the headlining act at Rock in Rio, the biggest festival to be held anywhere in the world. They again made history that year with the show-stealing performance at Live Aid from Wembley Stadium, which proved to be a turning point for the band, One Vision being the first post Live Aid release.", "1986 saw their 14th album, A Kind Of Magic, which was the soundtrack to the Russel Mulcahy film, Highlander. The title track became another worldwide smash and the album entered the UK charts at No. 1; later in the year the 2nd live album, Live Magic, went into the charts at No. 3. Between 1988 and 1991 Queen released three more albums, The Miracle in 1989 and in 1991 Innuendo and Greatest Hits II. All three entered the UK charts at No. 1, as did the single Innuendo.", "On 23rd November 1991 Freddie Mercury announced to the world that he had AIDS and the next day he died peacefully at his home, surrounded by family and friends. He remains the most high profile loss from the disease in the entertainment world and the news shocked fans throughout the world. As a tribute Bohemian Rhapsody / These Are The Days Of Our Lives was released as a double A-sided single to raise funds for the Terence Higgins Trust. It entered the UK chart at No. 1, where it stayed for five weeks, raising over £1,000,000 for the charity and Queen became the first band to have the same single top the UK charts twice. In December of that year Queen had 10 albums in the UK Top 100. In 1992 Freddie was awarded posthumously the BRIT’s “Outstanding Contribution to British Music” and Days Of Our Lives won Best Single. On 20th April many of the world’s top stars joined Brian, Roger and John on stage at Wembley for an emotional tribute to Freddie.", "In 1995 the tracks that Queen had begun in 1991 were completed by Brian, Roger and John and the long-awaited Made In Heaven was released worldwide. It was the end of an era. Since then the phenomenon of Queen has remained, however, with continuing sales for their recorded output on CD and video. A ballet of their music by famous French choreographer Maurice Bejart was premiered at the National Theatre in Paris in 1997 and in May 2002 the hit musical We Will Rock You opened to sell-out audiences in London’s West End and continues to play to packed houses and standing ovations every night. Queen’s first DVD Greatest Video Hits Vol.1 was released at the end of October 2002, and yet another piece of Queen product entered the UK charts at number 1. October 2002 also saw Queen receive their own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Los Angeles, joining The Beatles as only one of a handful of non-US bands to receive the much coveted honour. Last year, 2004 they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Walk of Fame, and in the UK were voted by the public into the first UK Music Hall of Fame.",  "Queen’s musical has since opened in Australia, Spain, Las Vegas,USA, Russia, Germany and Japan and continues to have touring productions across the world.", "Brian and Roger continue to be ambassadors for the Mercury Phoenix Trust, the HIV/AIDS charity set up following the death of Freddie in 1991. To date the charity has helped over 800 projects worldwide and raised over $16 million in the fight against the disease.", "Brian and Roger took Queen back onto the touring circuit for the first time since 1986 in 2005 and 2008, joined by former Free/Bad Company singer, songwriter and musician Paul Rodgers playing concerts across the UK and throughout Europe.", "Since 2012 Queen have enjoyed a fruitful collaboration with US singer/songwriter Adam Lambert and have toured extensively across North and South America, Europe, the UK, Asia and Australia and New Zealand."]

All but one of the tracks were produced by Queen, Roy Baker and Trident's resident producer John Anthony, with The Night Comes Down instead produced by the band and Louie Austin at De Lane Studios. The engineers for the sessions were Roy Baker, Mike Stone, Ted Sharpe and David Hentschel.", "The cover artwork was devised by Brian, Freddie and photographer friend Douglas Puddifoot and is based upon a shot taken on stage by Puddifoot during an early Queen concert. The band members thought the image of Freddie performing beneath a lone spot-light was an appropriate cover for the first album.", "This album saw the beginning of the famous 'Nobody played synths' note, which was to become such a familiar aspect of all Queen LPs right up to 1980's The Game. The band were fed up with people mistaking their elaborate multi-tracking and innovative guitar effects for synthesizers, when in fact much of the sound was created by Brian on his guitar using the band's own equipment and pioneering recording techniques - including the John designed 'Deacy amp' which is still used to this day.", "The famous Queen Crest logo seen on the back of the first album was designed by Freddie around this time, and became a familiar sight on most of the band's product.", "Queen was released on July 13th 1973 in the UK attained Gold sales status. In America it was issued in September, with a revised pink cover replacing the usual purple one, and also reached Gold sales.","Singles from this album: Keep Yourself Alive / Liar."]

			"info": ["Queen's second album was produced by Robin Geoffrey Cable, Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, and engineered by the ever-resourceful Mike Stone. Recorded at London's Trident Studios in August 1973, the band were at last permitted to use the studio during normal hours and, unlike the first album, take proper time to experiment with the myriad of ideas they had for new techniques, textures and sounds. Finally, Queen could record an album how they wanted, when they wanted, and without the limitations imposed upon them throughout the debut work.", "Numerous problems beset the album's release. Not least, its completion coincided with the 1973 oil crisis and consequently government-enforced measures for energy conservation delayed its manufacture by several months. Furthermore, when the first pressing arrived in record shops, the band noticed a spelling error on the sleeve and complained persistently before it was finally corrected.", "The album cover concept was based on a photograph of Marlene Dietrich that Freddie had seen, and Mick Rock was brought in to achieve a similar effect. The image has since become one of the most recognisable and frequently used of the band, and is as striking today as it was in the 1970s.", "In contrast to this iconic predominantly black portrait of Queen, the inner gatefold photograph features the band in equally grand attire, but this time dressed in white, against a white backdrop. The theme was continued inside the album too, for instead of the usual Side 1 and 2, the original Queen II LP comprised Side White and Side Black, each one representing the band members' individual song writing talents. Freddie's contributions to the album, including the majestic March Of The Black Queen, would occupy Side Black, while Roger's track for the album, and all of Brian's, including White Queen, were presented on Side White. John had not yet begun his song writing for Queen - his first composition would follow later in 1974, on the Sheer Heart Attack LP. The Black/White theme was a major part of Queen in 1974, not just on record or in terms of artwork and design, but on stage too, in terms of costume.", "Queen II was released on March 8th 1974, coinciding with an extensive UK tour that began at the start of the month. It would eventually climb to No 5 in the UK chart, helped considerably by constant touring, the band’s first hit single Seven Seas Of Rhye (released two weeks earlier) and their first appearances on the BBC's Top Of The Pops television show. The album gave Queen their first UK/USA Gold status LP.", "Singles from this album: Seven Seas Of Rhye / White Queen (on Queen’s First EP)."]

			"info": ["Queen's third studio album was recorded between July and September 1974 at four different studios in England and Wales and was produced by Queen and Roy Thomas Baker, with once again Mike Stone as engineer.", "Somewhat of a departure from the first two albums, Sheer Heart Attack had much more of a group feel about it, a coherence not possible to achieve previously because of the erratic way in which its predecessors were recorded. The first album, for example, was famously recorded in 'downtime' with the band permitted to use Trident studios only when no one else was using it. This album by contrast was recorded without those distractions in more calm and orthodox conditions and ultimately gave rise to a strong and greatly diverse piece of work containing several of the band's best-loved classics. This was much more of an accomplishment than might be apparent, given that Brian was absent from many sessions due to contracting Hepatitis while on tour in America in May and only being available to record his guitar and vocal parts relatively late in the proceedings. It was far from ideal but none of this is evident on the final work, and more than forty years on the album remains a firm favourite among Queen devotees. It has consistently been voted in the top 5 favourite albums in fan polls.", "Sheer Heart Attack is a more pop orientated work than its two predecessors, and indeed Killer Queen was the song that provided the band with the international hit and acclaim that Seven Seas Of Rhye never quite achieved. Brian would later observe, “For some strange reason we seemed to get a rather different feel on Sheer Heart Attack because of the way we were forced to record it (referring to his illness) and even allowing for all the problems we had, none of us were really displeased with the final result. “Roger, “It's my favourite. It holds together very well. It's much more concise. It's very varied and dynamic. The different sounds were pleasing.”", "Killer Queen is the best known song on the album, for which Freddie would later be awarded his first Ivor Novello award, and also featured is Stone Cold Crazy, the first Queen song credited to all four band members, and one of the very first songs the band experimented with in the earliest rehearsals and shows. Brian’s Now I’m Here is present too, which would be issued as a single, as too is John’s first composition for Queen, Misfire. Roger’s hard-paced Sheer Heart Attack, although intended for this album was never finished in time and so appeared much later - on News Of The World in 1977", "Like Queen II, the front cover image was photographed by Queen's good friend Mick Rock - the man of whom it was said, 'captured the 70s'. To achieve the unique look we see on the cover, the band members were smeared in Vaseline and then sprayed with water to achieve a very particular and some might say 'odd' look. Nevertheless, it had the desired effect, as the Sheer Heart Attack cover is both (cardiac) arresting and memorable.", "Sheer Heart Attack was released on November 8th 1974 and reached No 2 in the UK, achieving Gold status. It would be the first Queen album to reach the Top 20 in the USA, achieving a very impressive No 12 position and also earning Gold status.", "Singles from this album: Killer Queen / Flick Of The Wrist / Now I’m Here / Tenement Funster (on Queen’s First EP)."]

			"info": ["Queen's fourth and probably best known album, was recorded in England between August and November 1975. Such was the complexity of the compositions that no less than six different studios were employed, with the band members often recording various parts simultaneously in order to work most efficiently and get through it all. The sessions were long and gruelling and spanned four long months. Once again the band produced the album with trusted collaborators, Roy Thomas Baker and Mike Stone, and what emerged was a genuine triumph on all levels, meticulously pieced together to make the best possible album. A Night At The Opera would propel Queen on to the world stage on a mammoth scale and establish them as a major international force. Though it was never in any doubt within the band, it proved that Seven Seas Of Rhye and Killer Queen were not fleeting hits from another glam-type British wannabe band; Queen were here to stay and Bohemian Rhapsody and A Night At The Opera would confirm it for those in any doubt.", "It is a matter of public record that a very great deal hinged upon the success or failure of this album. Had it failed, it is entirely feasible the band would not have survived and Queen may well have ended there and then. Despite having two top ten albums under their belt, and significant international hits with Seven Seas and Killer Queen, and sell-out shows all around Britain, the band was in serious financial difficulty by the start of 1975. Recording and relentless touring for three solid years had still not yielded anything like what the band were due, and, to add insult to injury, Roger, John, Brian and Freddie were still struggling to get by on the minimal wage from Trident, to whom they were signed. Enter the story at this point, Jim Beach, the lawyer who would eventually negotiate Queen's release from Trident's grasp and from the deal that had so far afforded such little reward for the band. It would be some years before the band formerly parted company with Trident. Eventually Queen were extricated from their deal and left to make A Night At The Opera without distraction or financial pressure. So, with a clean slate and blank canvas on which to create, the much relieved Queen, along with stalwarts Roy Thomas Baker and Mike Stone, committed the next quarter of a year to the meticulous and all-consuming craft of honing the album that Brian would later refer to as ‘Queen's Sgt Peppers’.", "The album cover was given a simple but lavish treatment, with Freddie's original crest design updated and coloured and placed centre of the album cover. The LP gatefold complimented the style, with the lyrics printed over two sides of the inside cover, and for the first time the inner sleeve was in colour and featured live photos from Queen’s most recent tour.", "A Night At The Opera is a wonderfully rich and diverse gathering of carefully constructed and, some might say, unlikely compositions from all four band members. Every track is strong and every moment from beginning to end is beautifully recorded. The late lamented Mike Stone (engineer), who sadly passed away in 2002, once again played an integral part in achieving the sound of this album. Opera spans all kinds of musical styles and genres and veers off at tangents as unlikely the album title itself.", "Aside from the well known material, also on this album is to be found Freddie's exquisite Love Of My Life, rumoured to have been inspired by his long time girlfriend of the time Mary Austin.", "A Night At The Opera was finally finished in early November of 1975 and released to worldwide critical acclaim later that month on the 21st. It very quickly became Queen's first No 1 album, and also their first to achieve Platinum sales status. It went top 5 in the USA and achieved Gold status there, helped in no small part by extensive tours of North America and Canada earlier in the year.", "Singles from this album: Bohemian Rhapsody / You’re My Best Friend / Death On Two Legs (on Queen’s First EP)."]

It was the first to be self-produced - the preceding four LPs were co-produced with Roy Thomas Baker (and John Anthony on Queen) - and engineered by Mike Stone.", "The album followed its predecessor A Night At The Opera in borrowing its title from a film by the Marx Brothers. Like A Night At The Opera - which many think of as its sister album - A Day At The Races is a greatly diverse work, exploring all kinds of musical styles and genres; from the heavy Tie Your Mother Down and White Man, to Freddie's delicate You Take My Breath Away and John's You And I. It has been stated many times over the years, by Brian and Roger mostly, that the band saw this album more or less as a continuation of the previous LP. Indeed, so much so, that the two might even have been released simultaneously. A Day At The Races finds Queen during a highly inventive and motivated period. All four members are writing and creating at a furious rate and within four months they produce several of their most acclaimed recordings, best loved singles, and, in the minds of many, one of their finest and most complete albums.", "Freddie's Somebody To Love, among the best-known Queen songs of all, was to become the biggest single of the album. It was also among its author's favourite own compositions, as Freddie would occasionally recall. Like Bohemian Rhapsody, Somebody To Love features complex layered vocal tracks, though this time based on a gospel choir arrangement; a combination of Freddie, Brian and Roger's multi-tracked voices to achieve the impression of a 100-voice gospel choir. It is staggering to think that the colossal choirs on this recording could have been produced from just three voices, but that is the case. The various band members have stated many times over the years that it is pure good fortune and luck that the three voices merge so wonderfully together to provide such a distinctive part of the Queen sound.", "A Day At The Races was released on December 10th 1976 and peaked at No 1 in the UK. In America, issued a week later, it reached No 5 on the US Billboard album chart and became Queen's first American album to achieve Gold status - and subsequently Platinum.", "Singles from this album: Somebody To Love / Tie Your Mother Down / Long Away / Teo Torriatte / Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy (on Queen’s First EP)."]

			"info": ["Queen's sixth studio album was recorded between July and September 1977 at two studios, Basing Street and Wessex. The band produced the record themselves for the first time, without Roy Thomas Baker but still assisted by Mike Stone.", "In terms of musical content, News Of The World was a significant departure from the two albums preceding it. The band spent half the time they had previously taken to record this album (roughly ten weeks) and this accounts for the comparatively sparse production and certain songs emerging with what many would describe as an under-produced sound - by Queen standards anyway.", "The album cover features a striking image of the band adapted from a painting by esteemed American science-fiction artist Frank Kelly Freas. The unsettling depiction of a giant robot plucking the four band members from a shattered auditorium, is among the most affecting of all Queen related imagery, as is a further picture inside of the robot stretching out his hand to snatch petrified fleeing audience members. The idea came from Roger who had seen a copy of an American magazine called Astounding Science, and thought that with a little adaptation it would make an excellent cover for the new Queen album. Kelly Freas loved the idea of his creation being adapted to this unlikely scenario and agreed to alter the picture to show the band members in the robot's blood-stained hand. It is among the most striking and memorable of any album artwork, and numerous worldwide singles from the LP, as well as myriad of weird and wonderful merchandise items too numerous to list, featured variations of the scene.", "The first single released from News Of The World was the worldwide coupling of We Are The Champions and We Will Rock You, penned by Freddie and Brian respectively. Released on October 7th, the single reached No 2 in the charts and also realised a Billboard No 2 position in the USA. Although it is often said that Crazy Little Thing Called Love (1979) was Queen's first American chart topper, the Champions / Rock You single reached the top spot of Record World's chart, and thus, technically, gave the band their first American No 1.

Sessions for Jazz began at Mountain Studios in Switzerland, in July 1978, and later moved to Super Bear studios in Nice, France, concluding in October. Producer Roy Thomas Baker had been absent on the previous two LPs, but for this project the team was reunited - though it would prove to be the last Queen/Baker production. Geoff Workman and John Etchells were the engineers.","Once again the finished album was very different to anything before. The change of scenery in terms of recording studios gave rise to a fresh exuberant sounding album and once again a richly diverse range of songs - 13 no less! This period saw the emergence of several tracks that would go on to become not only significant international hits, but great favourites among the fans and staples of the Queen live show for the remainder of the 1970s and well into the 80s.","The unusual front/back cover concept was suggested by Roger, who had seen a similar design painted on the Berlin Wall some months earlier. The finished cover raised more than a few eyebrows at the time, as it was a significant departure from previous Queen albums and seemed to have little relevance to the album's title. The inside gatefold illustration was that of a wide-angle photograph of the band taken at the Montreux recording studios during the sessions by one of the band's roadies, while the inner sleeve photograph was instead taken at Super Bear studios in France by Chris Hopper.", "Queen took the unusual step here in including a large poster inside the album – a now infamous poster - featuring a bevy of beautiful naked girls (models recruited from various agencies) riding bicycles around Wimbledon Stadium in London in their very own 'bicycle race' with a difference!

Further caution was necessary for the Bicycle Race / Fat Bottomed Girls single picture sleeves, not just in the U.S, but in all territories, with the offending girl racer suddenly sporting painted on pink underwear, even though she was cycling away from the camera. Elektra American even went a stage further by adding a bra, and thus inadvertently creating various rare picture sleeves for eager fans to track down – even all these years later!", "As with previous albums, Jazz offered a varied mixture of song styles, reflecting a frenetic period in the band's song writing. Queen had returned to a 'back to basics' feel for the previous album, but for this, in new surroundings and with the assistance of Roy Thomas Baker, they experimented again and explored an even wider range of musical avenues, just as they had on the earliest albums.", "Jazz was released in the UK on 10th November 1978 and four days later in America.", "Singles from this album: Fat Bottomed Girls / Bicycle Race / Don’t Stop Me Now / Jealousy"]

The tracks, Save Me, Coming Soon, Sail Away Sweet Sister and Crazy Little Thing Called Love (the first single from the album, released a full seven months ahead of The Game) were recorded in June and July of 1979. Despite the fact that Queen had recently purchased their own recording studios in Montreux, Switzerland, they did not use it for this project. All tracks were recorded in Musicland in Munich and were produced by Queen and Mack. It was the first Queen/Mack co-venture but certainly not the last; the collaboration would go on to produce some of the band's finest work and be responsible for many of the biggest and best known hits.", "The Game marked a notable turning point for Queen in terms of musical style. For the first time they were experimenting with disco/funk rhythms and completely immersing themselves in the bass-driven grooves of the day. Whatever Queen did, and whatever the fall-out might be, good or bad, they embraced it wholeheartedly, and this album was no exception. The Game was the first Queen album to feature a synthesizer, though this aspect was unwelcome news to many long term fans who had been with Queen since the 'Nobody played synths' albums of the seventies. John in particular is known to enjoy soulful upbeat Motown and disco/dance music, and was the person most at ease with this significant change in direction. From these sessions came the mighty Another One Bites The Dust, a colossal international hit that gave John his first No 1 record. Inspired by the kind of bass lines so successfully employed by soul group Chic at that time, Bites The Dust came from nowhere to catapult Queen into the stratosphere and a whole new audience – even in the most unlikely quarters as the black funk clubs of New York.", "For many fans, The Game’s radically alternative feel was a change too far. While many new listeners were attracted to Queen for the first time, some of the long-term supporters regarded this foray into disco as the band selling out.

It was the band's first sortie into the film world and would prove to be their only full soundtrack album. Later they would write several songs for the first Highlander adventure in 1986, which emerged (in reworked form) as the album A Kind Of Magic, also in that year, but that was not a soundtrack LP.", "The Flash Gordon music was recorded for Director Mike Hodges and Producer Dino De Laurentiis' $22 million remake of the 1930's black and white sci-fi film. Queen were first approached in 1979, and as writing film music was something they had all thought about but had not yet got around to, their Manager arranged a meeting with De Laurentiis and mentioned Queen's interest in scoring the film. Rumour has it that De Laurentiis' first reaction was simply, “Who are the Queens?” They were, as it turned out, the first rock band he had ever listened to and the outcome was that the band was commissioned to write the music for the movie.", "Brian later explained, “We saw 20 minutes of the finished film and thought it very good and over the top. We wanted to do something that was a real soundtrack. It's a first in many ways, because a rock group had not done this type of thing before, or else it's been toned down and they've been asked to write mushy background music. Whereas we were given the license to do what we liked, as long as it complimented the picture.”", "Having just finished a lengthy European tour, and a further three week stint in Japan, spanning January to May, Queen spent the summer of 1979 working on The Game album, mostly at Musicland studios in Munich. It was during these sessions that they also started work on the score for Flash Gordon. Producing two albums simultaneously was not easy, but both progressed well. After touring, holidays and other ventures, more work on Flash Gordon and The Game followed in the early part of 1980, again in Munich, and then a U.S. tour commenced in June and ran through to October. After a well-earned holiday for most of October, Queen recommenced work on the Flash soundtrack in London and had completed it by November.","The music was composed, performed, arranged and produced by Queen, with the overall album credited as a Brian and Mack production. Like The Game, which was the first Queen LP to feature synthesizers, Flash Gordon continued the trend, though it features significantly more synths than its predecessor. Additional orchestral arrangements on the album were by Howard Blake, who also conducted the orchestra, and all of it was recorded at Anvil Studios. The orchestra features mostly throughout the film, to compliment Queen's music, though some of it did also make the final soundtrack album too.", "The album cover concept came from Freddie; the Flash Gordon logo over a vivid yellow background, and with a scene from the film on the back, while the inner sleeve featured four individual photos of the band taken during the 1980 USA Game Tour by regular Queen live photographer Neal Preston.", "Though some fans were dubious to hear Queen were recording music for a comic character-inspired film adventure, the album that emerged was a pleasant surprise on various levels. The music works well as an accompaniment to the visuals of the film, punctuated by sound effects and dialogue from the cast, including Max Von Sydow, Timothy Dalton, Topol and the larger than life English actor Brian Blessed. Any reservations among the fans were soon cast aside when the album's only single Flash was released worldwide prior to the album and fared well in the charts.", "Roger: “We've been offered quite a few films, but Flash Gordon was something which Brian and I were quite attracted to because of its sci-fi thirties connotations. The album was totally under our control and it was our idea to put dialogue on the album. That wasn't the original concept. We thought we'd get little snippets to give some idea of what was happening in the film and some atmosphere of the story.”", "All tracks were titled after the appropriate part of the film each part was written for, and when hearing the album in its own right the listener gets a vivid idea as to what's happening in the story. The drama of the action, dialogue and over the top special effects, with Queen's distinctive sound threading through it all, is a compelling and greatly unusual blend.", "Flash Gordon was released in the UK on 8th December 1980 – a day that will forever live in history as a notorious date because it happens to be the day that John Lennon was shot dead outside his apartment in New York.", "The album reached No 10 in the UK charts, achieving Gold award status. It was well received by the press and critics alike and each review of the film made a special reference to the music from Queen. The LP was nominated for a BAFTA award and an Ivor Novello, and the film premiered in London on 11th December 1980.", "Single from this album: Flash."]

Mack also engineered the LP, with David Richards, who would go on to enjoy a long working relationship with the band lasting until the very last album fourteen years later. The last track on the album, Under Pressure was produced by Queen and David Bowie.", "After the success of 1980’s The Game and then a huge ground-breaking South America tour in February and March of 1981, the band headed for the recording studio they had recently purchased, Mountain Studios in Montreux, to see what would happen. They had no new material to work on, just a few ideas, but this was nothing new to Queen or their various associate producers, and soon a flurry of songs emerged.", "Queen were greatly prolific during this period and in addition to the eleven songs that ultimately made the album, several further tracks were started but never finished. This was not unusual for Queen at this time; certain ideas remaining in the archive in various states of development only to be revisited years later for subsequent albums.", "Like The Game, two years earlier, Hot Space was a huge departure for Queen in terms of musical direction. With such a massive international hit, Another One Bites The Dust (1980), behind them – and a No 1 in America - it probably came as no surprise that the band would want to continue down the disco/funk path to some extent. This policy did however make the album less popular with some fans; those who preferred the traditional heavier rock style they had come to expect from Queen. Hot Space does have its heavy moments, though; Brian's Put Out The Fire and Dancer, for example, contain some of the most aggressive guitar work of any Queen album.", "Also using the studio at this time was an old friend of the band, David Bowie. Producer David Richards suggested they should meet up and see what happened. No-one imagined it would work as well as it did, or that an international No 1 smash hit was to follow. After a jam session late into the night, and with a couple of demos recorded, the five musicians recognised they had the essence of a new song. After much work the following day, and a myriad of titles changes and tempos later, the piece would emerge as Under Pressure, most recognisable for John's distinctive bass line, and the rest is history. The single would be included on the new Hot Space album as the closing track and would be the first single issued from it.", "Released in the UK on 21st May 1982, and four days later in the USA, Hot Space reached No 4 in the UK, achieving Gold sales status – as it did in the U.S. too. Although not reaching the dizzy heights of success its predecessor The Game achieved, the album sold better in Europe, reaching No 1 in Austria and No 2 in Holland, as well as top ten chart positions throughout the rest of the continent.", "Singles from this album: Under Pressure / Body Language / Las Parabras De Amor / Back Chat / Calling All Girls / Staying Power."]

The project began life as the soundtrack to the motion picture Highlander, after director Russell Mulcahy had commissioned a handful of tracks from Queen. He regarded them as the ideal band for the task and would later comment that it was always Queen he had in mind because of their strong, anthemic songs. The band was so impressed with the first 20 minutes of rough footage they were shown, that further tracks soon followed and the A Kind Of Magic album was born.", "Each band member was inspired by different parts of the story and in evidence the album covers a wide spectrum of emotion. The songs are full of references to the film dialogue and its main characters and events - There can be only one! / No mortal man can win this day / The prize / It's a kind of magic / Don't lose your head.", "Brian was greatly moved by the death of Heather in the film (the main character's first and greatest love) and by the dialogue surrounding her final moments as she lay dying in the arms of her beloved MacLeod - the immortal Highlander - on the spectacular Scottish highland. MacLeod is destined to be without Heather for the rest of time and suddenly the prospect seems impossible to face. Who Wants To Live Forever is the song that emerged from this poignant moment of the movie, written by Brian on the drive home after viewing the first assembly footage.", "Roger, meanwhile, was taken with the lines “There can be only one!” and “It's a kind of magic!” - later gaving rise to his song of similar name. The battles in Highlander have been raging through many centuries and are only now, in the 1980s, coming to a head. This aspect too is covered in the song.","The main characters of the story, most notably The Highlander Connor MacLeod and his nemesis The Kurgan, have been relentlessly battling through the ages in order to secure the ultimate reward, the greatest prize of all, immortality (and some degree of peace, finally). Around this concept, Brian conceived his song Gimme The Prize. There is only one way to win the prize, however, and that is to be the last man standing, achievable only by the grim process of beheading all opponents – because ‘There can be only one!’ Another Roger song, Don't Lose Your Head (featuring incidental vocals from English vocalist Joan Armatrading), emerges from this idea, a recurring theme as the film builds and each warrior inevitably meets his gruesome end, until only two are left for the finale confrontation.", "Freddie's anthemic Princes Of The Universe (the proposed original title of the film) is a typical no-nonsense piece which, for release as a single in 1986, required an equally powerful video. What emerged was a startling screen duel between actor Christopher Lambert recreating his Highlander role, complete with head-dispensing sword, and Freddie, armed only with faithful microphone stand. The two do battle amid a scene of devastation, while Brian, Roger and John play on regardless. It is breathtaking footage, with Freddie looking even more menacing than the sword-wielding Highlander, and in which, thankfully, neither man is parted from his head.", "Certain tracks on the Magic album are significantly different to those featured in the film, particularly the title track, as the band reworked the material after the Highlander post-production was completed. Renowned composer Michael Kamen provided the score for most of the incidental music throughout the film, and the rare combination of his original music and dynamic Queen songs from all four band members, proved a formidable alliance.", "Though it appeared six months ahead of the LP, in November 1985, One Vision (coupled with the non-album instrumental piece Blurred Vision) was the first single issued from the album. Produced by Queen and Mack and recorded at Musicland in Germany, it was notably the first Queen single written jointly by the band. Inspired by their acclaimed performance at Live Aid several months earlier, universally regarded as their greatest concert triumph of all, Queen returned to the studio with renewed vigour to come up with this much loved track. The artwork for the single features a portrait taken by famous photographer David Bailey backstage at Live Aid, while the accompanying video was filmed in September at Musicland studios while the band were working on the album there. Shot over a period of weeks, the video offers a rare insight into Queen at work in the studio and also enjoying free time.","A Kind Of Magic released on June 2nd 1986 and entered the UK charts at No 1. It achieved double Platinum status at home and abroad and it topped the charts in many other territories.", "Singles from this album: One Vision / A Kind Of Magic / Friends Will Be Friends / Who Wants To Live Forever / Princes Of The Universe / Pain Is So Close To Pleasure."]

The Magic Tour of Europe was Queen's most successful ever, generating in excess of £11 million and playing to over one million people. The UK leg was, at the time, the largest grossing tour in the history of British rock music, setting an all time attendance record and outselling previous tours by Bruce Springsteen and The Rolling Stones.", "The album begins with the intro part of One Vision, and while the immense stage is engulfed by smoke, and the largest lighting rig Queen ever employed reveals the stage, the band run on and thrash out the opening chords of this much loved and dramatic Live Aid-inspired favourite. The recording comes from the Knebworth show, as does the majority of the content (only four songs were lifted from other shows), and finds Queen performing before the largest paying audience ever amassed in the UK. 120,000 fans congregated on the grounds of the park for what is generally referred to as 'A Night Of Summer Magic'.", "The album ends in similar way to most of Queen's latter shows, with a string of the band's best loved and biggest known anthems. Radio Ga Ga sees the audience participating in the synchronised (above heads) handclapping spectacle, and then, all too soon, We Will Rock You rings out and then Friends Will Be Friends and We Are The Champions, with the masses waving and singing along with Freddie until his final words of the night, “We love You.” The gigantic audience cheers for the last time as Champions closes and God Save The Queen begins, and the band leaves the stage together for the very last time.

It was produced by the band with David Richards, who also engineered the sessions with the help of various assistants. Having spent considerable time with the band on both Queen various solo ventures, Richards was now a permanent fixture on sessions and would remain so through to the final songs Freddie recorded in 1991.", "Prior to The Miracle sessions, the band had spent 1987 apart, working upon individual projects. Brian had produced songs for various artists, Freddie recorded the Barcelona album with Spanish opera star Montserrat Caballé, and Roger founded a brand new part-time band called The Cross. The year apart would prove greatly beneficial, as everyone came to the new project with renewed vigour and an abundance of fresh ideas. Queen would record many more tracks than they needed for The Miracle. Some would ultimately be utilised as single B-sides, while others remain unreleased in the archive.", "For the very first time on a Queen album, all the songs (and subsequent single B-sides) were credited as written by the band collectively, regardless of the actual author. This seemingly inconsequential detail was in fact significant and something of a liberating experience for the band. Not least of all, it bypassed the usual arguments over whose track should be chosen as a single and whose would not. Now, with Queen sharing equal royalties on all material, the road was clear to focus on other things.", "The striking cover artwork for the album was based on a concept conceived by Queen and represents the unity of the band; a seamless merging of four people becoming one. This was, after all, during the period when the Queen members were pulling together closely beneath a veil of secrecy in dealing with Freddie's deteriorating illness. Indeed, there was the very real likelihood during these sessions that Freddie would not be around to complete the work. The band closed ranks like never before to focus on the work ahead and in order that nothing deterred them from their course. The four faces morphed into one on the cover, captures this feeling and remains today one of Queen’s most admired and universally recognised images. The startling back cover took the idea a step further, with a seamless regimented montage of just the band's eyes.", "Although there were rumors that a tour would be announced following the release of the album, sadly, for reasons that are now obvious, this was not to be. In May 1989 the band recorded a special interview for BBC Radio One in which Freddie explained to Mike Read that it was he who didn't want to tour. “We've been there and done that”, he said, and now the time had come for Queen to break the relentless 'album, tour, album, tour' routine. Freddie went so far as to say that at his age he didn't feel he should be running around a stage in a leotard any more.", "The Miracle album was originally to be called The Invisible Men, but was changed just a few weeks prior to the release date.

Produced by Queen and David Richards, Innuendo contains several of the band's best-known hits and, subsequently, some of the most memorable and poignant videos. It would prove to be the last album Freddie worked upon and yet also, despite his palpably deteriorating health, a work containing some of his most powerful and emotive vocal performances of all.", "At the time of the Innuendo sessions, only a few people closest to Freddie knew the extent of his illness and just how little time was left. As has been confirmed several times since, the four band members pulled together like never before in order to support Freddie in every possible way for as long as they could through the final months of his life. This included keeping the truth from the world's media until the very last moment. The fans, meanwhile, though having seen Freddie's startling appearance in the I’m Going Slightly Mad and These Are The Days Of Our Lives videos, and at the BPI awards ceremony on television, while aware something was wrong, were completely unprepared for the devastating news contained within Freddie's last press statement released one day before he died, in which he confirmed he was suffering with AIDS.", "Despite his personal anguish, Freddie somehow found the strength to muster some truly breathtaking vocal performances for Innuendo, digging deep within himself and finding a depth and spirit like never before. He seemed to find a new dimension to his voice and poured his heart and soul into every note. This is all the more remarkable when one considers his physical condition during this time, as is so evident in the aforementioned last videos he filmed. As Brian would later recall, Freddie could barely stand up during the final sessions, every hour he was present at Mountain studios required superhuman effort, and yet none of this is evident on the final album.", "It is impossible to believe that the extraordinary voice behind songs such as Headlong, All God's People, Don't Try So Hard, The Show Must Go On and the album's title track, could have been recorded by someone as physically weak as Freddie was. Many people agree that these performances (and those to emerge later on Made In Heaven) are not only great, but among the best and most moving of his entire career.", "As with its predecessor The Miracle, in 1989, all songs (but one) on Innuendo were credited to all four Queen members equally, regardless of who actually conceived them. (All God's People is the exception, originating from Freddie's 1988 Barcelona sessions and co-written with Mike Moran). This was another clever Freddie idea, and a rather generous one at that, when one considers that Freddie had historically written many of the band's most successful hits. The equal billing concept was the perfect solution to the age-old problem of whose track gets chosen as a single, whose tracks are B-sides, whose songs are disregarded, and all the related writing royalty issues that always arise. These troublesome aspects of albums and singles have dogged numerous bands through the decades. They’ve been the catalyst for endless arguments and have split many a great group up, but from 1989 onwards, for Queen at least, the problem was overcome with Freddie's forward-thinking.", "When Innuendo emerged in February 1991, with the cloak of secrecy around Freddie still tighter than ever, Queen fans loved it and it was universally acclaimed by the press. Reviews were uncommonly flattering and with the title track song having already entered the UK charts at No 1 a month earlier, Queen were very much back with a bang!", "With hindsight, many of the songs on Innuendo are extremely personal, which was not necessarily evident at the time the LP emerged. Certain songs are clearly written in the knowledge that Freddie's battle for life is nearing the end, and with the band members struggling to come to terms with the imminent reality of losing the person they would later describe as ‘the most beloved member of our family.’", "Both Brian and Roger would later recall that the Innuendo sessions, and subsequent recordings that would eventually make up the Made In Heaven album (released four years after Freddie's death), was a curious mixture of sadness and joy, with great humor and some of the best times the four men ever enjoyed together. The band united like never before to make maximum use of every second available to them in the studio. They recorded as much as they could in the time they had left, precisely as Freddie requested.", "The Show Must Go On has to be singled out as probably the most poignant and emotive recording on the album, and of course is the track that closes the LP. Freddie and Brian conceived and developed this song together, with Brian furiously scribbling down lyrics for Freddie to record while he still could. It is a triumph on every level, and of course it would become a much loved Queen classic.", "The Innuendo album cover was designed by the band and Richard Gray and featured various illustrations inspired by an 18th century illustrator called Granville (1803-1847). The idea had come from Roger when he found a book of illustrations and showed one particular black and white pencil drawing, A Juggler Of Universes, to the band. They loved it and Richard Gray was called in with a view to adapting the image for the front cover. Additional illustrations by Angela Lumley also based on Granville's work were used on the back cover and for numerous subsequent worldwide singles sleeves.", "The Innuendo album was released on Feb 4th 1991 and a week later crashed into the UK album charts at No 1, ultimately achieving Platinum sales status. It would soon attain the No 1 position in Holland, Switzerland, Germany, Finland, Portugal and Italy.", "Singles from this album: Innuendo / I’m Going Slighly Mad / Headlong / The Show Must Go On / These Are The Days Of Our Lives."]

			"info": ["Queen’s third concert album, Live At Wembley ’86, was Produced by Queen and recorded at London’s Wembley Stadium on July 12th 1986 - the second of two nights there - and was part of the UK leg of the mighty Magic Tour of Europe.", "The Magic Tour of Europe started in Sweden on June 7th and culminated at Knebworth Park in Hertfordshire England on August 9th. The two Wembley shows followed dates all around Europe and two more dates in the UK in Ireland and Newcastle, with Manchester shortly following Wembley. The band donated the profits of the show in Newcastle (which sold out within one hour of going on sale) on July 9th to the Save The Children charity, to help the fund’s work in the UK and overseas.", "The band played to over 400,000 people in the UK in 1986, with an audience of 150,000 at Wembley alone. These were the first proper Queen shows at this prestigious location, using their own lighting rig, stage and sound equipment, having previously been part of the line up at Live Aid a year earlier, where of course a host of other guests also performed, with everyone sharing the same stage set-up.", "Originally only one night at Wembley was planned, but as the first show on Saturday July 12th sold out within just a few hours, it was decided a further concert be added on Friday. Thus, Queen became only the third rock act in history to play two successive concerts at the stadium.", "It is well documented that Queen always staged the most spectacular and extraordinary shows when they toured, and the Magic concerts were no exception. The two Wembley shows broke all previous attendance records, and this had also been the case elsewhere in Europe. The show itself incorporated the largest lighting rig ever assembled for a live show, weighing over nine and a half tons. The stage was the largest ever erected at Wembley Stadium and measured 160 ft wide and over 52 ft high from ground level to the top of the lights. It was capable of filling one entire end of Wembley and was so heavy that supports had to be bored into the concrete foundations of the stadium.", "The immense sound system was powered by over half a million watts, with revolutionary delay towers, and entailed the use of 180 speakers facing the audience at every show. A 20’ x 30’ Starvision screen made its debut appearance at Wembley and was used again later at Knebworth (for the last ever Queen concert) to bring the stage action to the audience members at the very back of the venue. Due to the tremendous weight of the screen, which was positioned above the centre of the stage, a huge water reservoir was required at the rear of the stage to counterbalance it. Everything about the Magic Tour was on a huge scale, and so it became one of the most memorable of the band’s career.", "This Wembley concert was filmed in its entirety by Gavin Taylor and used 15 cameras positioned around the stadium plus an airborne helicopter camera. The film was purchased by Channel 4 and on October 25th 1986 an edited version of the show, Real Magic, was broadcast simultaneously on TV and on all independent radio network stations, attracting 3.5 million viewers.", "Live At Wembley ‘86 was released in the UK on May 26th 1992 and climbed to No 2 in the charts."]

It was a difficult and enormously challenging process on many levels, unprecedented in terms of personal anguish, but when Made In Heaven emerged it quickly established itself as one of Queen's finest and most accomplished pieces of work.", "Made In Heaven was recorded at Mountain Studios in Montreux Switzerland and was produced by Queen. It was co produced and engineered by David Richards, with assistance from Justin Shirley-Smith and Joshua J. Macrae. The album title dates back to a track on Freddie's first solo album in 1985, which the band had reworked for this project.", "Despite being told by his doctors in 1989 that he might not be around long enough to finish The Miracle, Freddie did finish it, and indeed he completed the next project too, Innuendo, in 1991. His health and physical condition was severely compromised throughout the sessions, but through innumerable difficulties he remained focused and determined to record more and more vocals until he could record no more. It was his wish that wherever possible, and particularly in terms of work, that things carry on as normal. The first half of 1991 saw an unusual period of recording like no other in the band's career, governed largely by Freddie and his failing health.", "Brian: “By the time we were recording these tracks we'd had the discussions and knew that we were totally on borrowed time. So our plan was to just make full use of Freddie as much as possible. We basically lived in the studio for a while and he would call and say, 'I can come in for a few hours today'. Our plan was just to make as much use of him as we could. He said, 'Get me to sing anything. Write me anything and I will sing it. I will give it my ALL. I will leave you as much material as I possibly can'.”", "Roger: “Freddie knew his time was limited and he really wanted to work and to keep going. He felt that that was the best way to keep his spirits up, and he wanted to leave as much as possible. We certainly agreed, so we backed him up right to the hilt.", "“With The Miracle he wasn't that well, but he wasn't that ill. And that was more of an effort, a bit of a long album to make. But for 'Innuendo', he really wasn't very well. I think there are some extraordinary performances on that one. I find it a very strong album all the way through. It's quite emotional.”", "No-one knew when or even if Freddie would return for more recordings, or which session would be his last. The entire recording process was, to borrow from a Freddie song title, very much in the lap of the gods.", "Brian: “A lot of it was really, strangely enough, quite joyous. It sounds odd to say that, and people are going to hate me for saying it, but I know Freddie had some very good times in those last periods. It was tough, but there was a lot of joy during the final recordings. Freddie did not let it become downbeat. He was always 'Up' if he was in the recording studio, always full of ideas, enthusiasm and great passion.”", "Roger: “I think the last thing that he wanted was to draw attention to any kind of weakness or frailty - which was all too obvious anyway. He didn't want any kind of pity or anything like that, and he was incredibly brave about the whole thing.”", "Brian: “I never saw him let it all get on top of him, never ever. He would always just get on with things. And we had some very funny times. We were very focused and very together as a group. I think we all realised how precious those moments possibly were going to be.”", "Sadly, the inevitable time came when Freddie could work no more. He had recorded his final sessions and never attended the studio again. The last recordings of Freddie were in the can, for the rest of Queen to work their collective magic upon when they felt able to. Now, with strict instructions from Freddie, it was up to John, Brian and Roger to complete the songs and album without their beloved colleague.", "In addition to brand new material, the Made In Heaven album also features tracks from Freddie's solo career, but in radically revised fashion; re-worked, but with all the familiar distinctive Queen trademarks and production techniques evident from beginning to end.", "The album cover concept by Queen and Richard Gray features the even more larger than life Freddie statue (sculpted by Irena Sedlecka) overlooking Lake Geneva in Switzerland, in a sumptuous sunrise setting - the place at which Freddie had written and recorded his last songs, and which had so inspired and influenced him. The gatefold sleeve reveals a similar view but this time taken at sunset.", "The statue is now a permanent fixture by the lake, with Freddie standing proud, purveyor of a spectacular landscape and the many people that come to visit him there. The effigy is every bit as imposing as Freddie was on stage and has become a great tourist attraction. Queen's inimitable front man stands tall, overseeing the view he himself enjoyed so much and indeed captured in the lyrics of one of his final songs, A Winter's Tale; swans floating by, sea-gulls flying over, a silky moon up in the sky, mountains zoomin' higher, quiet and peaceful, tranquil and blissful, a kind of magic in the air, a truly magnificent view, a breathtaking scene, an extraordinary place!", "Made In Heaven was released on November 6th 1995 and was promoted as 'The breathtaking final album'. Most significantly of all, John, Brian and Roger concluded the sleeve credits with, 'Dedicated to the immortal spirit of Freddie Mercury'.", "It became an instant favourite with the fans and gave Queen their most successful studio album to date. It immediately went to No 1 in the UK, as well as Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Holland, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and Spain. It achieved multiple Platinum sales status all around the world and would eventually sell in excess of 20 million copies", "Singles from this album: Heaven For Everyone / A Winter’s Tale / Too Much Love Will Kill You / Let Me Live / You Don’t Fool Me."]

			"info": ["As Freddie intimates on stage during this English concert of June 5th 1982, the Hot Space album caused something of a stir when it emerged two weeks earlier, both at home and in America. The album received widely ranging reviews from all quarters. Some regarded Queen’s foray into funk rock as a step too far, while others embraced it - as they had done previously when the band experimented with alternative musical styles and grooves, such as with Another One Bites The Dust in 1980.", "Liked or loathed, and regardless of its hugely contrasting reviews, many fans loved Hot Space, and so it achieved a very credible No 4 UK chart placing, in May 1982. Under Pressure, the first single, released a full six months ahead of the album, in October 1981, had stormed into the UK charts on its way to No 1 and was a massive international hit. Queen were firmly back on the world map again.", "1982 was an eventful and busy period for Queen, for no sooner had the album been handed in to EMI, a huge European tour was under way. Beginning in Sweden on April 9th and concluding with this Milton Keynes concert on June 5th, the tour comprised 30 performances, in 9 cities, at 22 venues. It took the band through Norway, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Austria, Scotland and England, and would also have included further illustrious English venues had things gone according to plan.",  "Applications to play at Manchester United and Arsenal football grounds (Old Trafford and Highbury) were made, but both were turned down. The proposed Manchester show was replaced by one in Leeds on May 29, and the Arsenal show, by this Milton Keynes concert. Plans for a further concert at the Albert Hall were also abandoned because of fears that the famous ceiling of the venue might cave in under the weight of Queen's vast lighting rig.", "As well as familiar favourites, the set now included new material from the Hot Space album - Action This Day, Staying Power and Back Chat. Under Pressure had already been introduced for two Canadian concerts six months earlier. Other material from the album will feature in the set in subsequent legs of the tour - Put Out The Fire, Calling All Girls, Life Is Real – but is absent for these European concerts.", "Queen seldom performed live during daylight hours, preferring instead to enter the stage under a blaze of lights and smoke. This concert is one of those rare occasions - as Freddie is quick to impart to the audience. “Hello everybody. You know it’s not very often that we do shows in the daylight. I fucking wish we had before; I can see you all now - and there’s some beauties here tonight, I can tell you.”", "The concert is filmed by Gavin Taylor and shortened highlights are later broadcast on the British Channel 4 music programme, The Tube. It is shown many times thereafter and is widely bootlegged, but then in 2004 it emerges in all its full and original glory on CD and DVD.", "Directing this performance is not easy, as Freddie risks life and limb by hanging precariously off the stage construction during numerous numbers, or else he races across the stage at breakneck speed before collapsing at the piano. Such antics are all in a night’s work for him, and his boundless energy never falters. The band were so impressed with the direction here that they later invited Gavin Taylor to oversee the filming of the July 1986 Wembley Stadium shows (which also made it to DVD years after).", "This wonderful concert races along at an astonishing pace, spanning many Queen albums and familiar hits, featuring both new and old material, and leaving the audience as exhausted as Freddie himself. “I feel positively knackered!” he confesses, after throwing himself around like a rag doll.", "A few days prior to the concert, Brian is interviewed by a journalist who is clearly irritated because Freddie will not speak with him. He asks, “What’s up with fruitcake Fred?”", "Brian: “He’s been torn apart and bitten so many times before, that he doesn’t want to say anything. It’s very difficult being a front man in a band, because the things you say often get twisted. In my position I can stand away and be objective, Freddie comes in for abuse. He’s part of the team and he doesn’t like it when he’s singled out. Would you?”", "On the actual day of the concert, only hours before the band are due on stage, a fan is interviewed and explains that the event will be his 23rd Queen concert. He then adds that up to this point he has travelled 8,000 miles (over the years) to see them. When asked why he’s there, he answers for many fans who feel the same way. “Sheer technical brilliance, good songs, and a good show.” No-one could have put it better!", "That is what the people have come to see, and the band, as ever, deliver a phenomenal performance in their usual uncompromising way. The daylight soon fades to night, the lighting rig blazes down, Freddie challenges the director to follow and keep up with him, and the band gives one of its most memorable concerts ever.", "The band arrive at the venue in a helicopter, and then later, immediately prior to the start of the show, they are seen again backstage; nervous and apprehensive and excited, waiting to go on and do their stuff. It is a rare insight, and shows an unusually anxious looking Roger and John. Freddie meanwhile, clad in white jeans and striking matching jacket, looks fantastic - anything but nervous.", "Queen On Fire – Live At The Bowl (the entire concert) was produced by Justin Shirley-Smith and engineered by Justin and Kris Fredriksson, from the original recordings by Mack and Mick McKenna. Executive producers were Brian and Roger. Both CD and DVD were released on October 25th 2004, in the UK and on November 9th in the U.S. The double CD reached No 20 in the UK charts, while the DVD (containing lots of bonus material) went to No 1."]

They undertook a huge tour of South America, with dates in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela and Mexico, a further tour of Japan, and two specially filmed concerts at the Forum in Montreal, Canada, in November. In between touring, the band began work on a new studio album - Hot Space, to emerge the following year.", "The previous year had seen Queen enjoying their most successful period in North America and Canada. They had topped both the U.S. singles and album charts with Another One Bites The Dust and The Game and they’d become the first band ever to top the UK singles, albums and video charts simultaneously, with Under Pressure, Greatest Hits and Greatest Flix.", "Queen’s historic excursion to Latin America in February and March 1981 would break the world attendance record for a paying concert when 131,000 Brazilians saw the band play Sao Paulo’s Morumbi stadium. 1981 was, John Deacon would later recall, ”a year for discovering new audiences we didn’t know existed.”", "The filming of the two concerts in Montreal was taken to a new level, with Queen becoming the first group to shoot an entire show in full cinema 35mm format. The footage would eventually be screened in cinemas throughout 1984 and then issued on home video in September of that year, titled We Will Rock You. After further releases on video throughout the 1980s and 90s, the show was eventually released in full in 2007 retitled Queen Rock Montreal. These products show the band in utterly stunning form and in breathtaking detail on the big screen. Both sound and visuals were revisited and meticulously enhanced and what emerged was a staggeringly sharp and impressive memento of two 1981 Queen concerts in Canada.", "The set-list features songs from the most recent album The Game, including the singles Play The Game, Save Me, Crazy Little Thing Called Love and Another One Bites The Dust, as well as big hits and live favourites We Will Rock You, Somebody To Love, Killer Queen, Bohemian Rhapsody and We Are The Champions. The set also includes a new track recorded with David Bowie only a month earlier, Under Pressure.", "Freddie: ”We didn't think we could work with any other musician, because we're very temperamental. And then, to work with Bowie, who's very temperamental as well... it was quite an eye-opener! There was some sort of electricity there. I just feel it's a unique combination.”", "Other tracks include a faster rockier version of We Will Rock You to open the show, followed by Let Me Entertain You, Dragon Attack and Now I’m Here, the latter including Freddie’s vocal interchange with the audience. Other highlights of the show are Get Down Make Love with its eerie harmonised middle section, a cover of Jailhouse Rock, Roger on lead vocals for I’m In Love With My Car, and Freddie and Brian (and acoustic guitar) for Love Of My Life, a love song that differs somewhat to the original recording on A Night At The Opera and which features the audience singing along to every word and nuance.", "As the end of the show draws close and God Save The Queen begins, Freddie offers his farewell to the audience. “So long. Good night Montreal. Thank you for being such a good sport.” Another show is over and so too another year for Queen."]

Few who turned up for that iconic performance could have predicted the band would go on to become one of the world’s most successful rock groups, although a good deal more may have suspected it after this stunning show. The concert marked the culmination of Queen’s countrywide tour, their first as headliners, and hot on the heels of a tour supporting Mott the Hoople in late 1973. Queen received rave reviews, almost unheard of for a support band, and it was obvious that they would soon be top of the bill. Momentum had been building since the release of the band’s eponymous album in July 1973 and, following their success on the Mott tour, at the beginning of 1974 they were tipped as Band of the Year in UK music publication Disc and Music Echo.", "Just before the March Rainbow gig, Queen performed their new single Seven Seas of Rhye on Top Of The Pops, a highly coveted slot that came about unexpectedly when David Bowie could not attend. The band made the most of it, delivering a thrilling performance that pushed the song to the Top 10 slot.", "Although Queen now had their first hit single under their belt, and the second album Queen II had just been released to critical acclaim, many felt that playing The Rainbow was overambitious. It was the premier London venue of the time, on a par with L.A.’s Palladium and New York’s Fillmore East. But the band had paid its dues, slugging it out in clubs and college halls for four years, and never doubting their own potential. The band’s confidence was vindicated when the venue quickly sold out the capacity of 3,000+ seats – with some fans paying as much as £1.20 for a ticket!", "Queen’s performance was spectacular from the second Freddie strutted onto the stage in his soon to become trademark white ‘eagle suit’, a tight-fitting number specially made for him by top fashion designer Zandra Rhodes, featuring flowing winged sleeves. He pranced and posed and captured the audience in seconds with his extraordinary voice and stage presence, while Brian provided the counterpoint with his ground-breaking guitar playing. The powerful ‘engine room’ (as the band liked to call it) of Roger and John completed a sound unlike anything British audiences had previously heard. Enraptured fans clapped and cheered, and gave the band a standing ovation.", "The show was recorded by Roy Thomas Baker, co-producer of Queen's first four studio albums, and was intended to be the band's debut live album, capturing the magic of a band in concert firing on all cylinders, Queen: Live at the Rainbow ’74 would undoubtedly have been a big success, but Queen’s ferocious creative momentum had produced a stack of new songs begging to be recorded and instead of releasing the live album the band went into the studio to record what was to become 1974's breakthrough album, Sheer Heart Attack. As a result the already completed Rainbow live album was shelved and consigned to the archives.", "Later in 1974 Queen had their first chart-topping single, Killer Queen, which encapsulated their brand of driving rock and clever lyrics. It appeared on Sheer Heart Attack, released in the autumn, and was a massive hit. It remains to this day many fans’ favourite Queen album. To celebrate this success and crown a remarkable year, Queen returned to The Rainbow in November 1974 for two sell-out gigs that were even more spectacular than the one in March. The shows included typically flamboyant performances of Now I’m Here with which they had been wowing audiences on the tour, and featured Freddie apparently appearing in a spotlight on opposite sides of the stage almost simultaneously.", "The November concerts received massive acclaim from fans and critics alike and won over many who had doubted the band’s potential. They capture Queen in all their glory: the dramatic stage presence, the highly original self-penned repertoire of songs, high-energy performances coupled with stunning melodic and harmonic content, and the uncompromising perfectionist approach to every aspect of their performance which is still maintained to this day.", "Queen dazzled their audiences in 1974 with an unforgettable show delivered with flair, confidence and uncommon panache, belying their youth. The tape machines were rolling, capturing the highly electric performances. In 2014, to mark the 40th anniversary of those legendary shows, Queen: Live at the Rainbow ’74 - lovingly restored, edited, mixed and digitally mastered - was finally issued and included much never previously seen footage."]

Melody Maker magazine had trumpeted the tour with the words “Britain’s most regal band await your presence”, and the reviews of the previous shows had been ecstatic. “Queen and their music, presentation, production – everything about them says that they are more important than any other band you’ve heard,” wrote British rock magazine Sounds. “Instead of simply treading the well-worn paths to pop glory, they have made their own paths,” added The Sun.", "Cherry-picked from Queen, Queen II, Sheer Heart Attack and the triumphant A Night At The Opera, the set-list showed every facet of the band, from the ornate hard rock of Keep Yourself Alive and Seven Seas Of Rhye to the baroque grandeur of The March Of The Black Queen, from the heavy metal strut of Ogre Battle and Son And Daughter to the playful genre-bending of Bring Back That Leroy Brown and Queen’s breakthrough hit Killer Queen. It was also the tour when Queen unleashed the soon-to-be-legendary Bohemian Rhapsody on an unsuspecting public – to a rapturous reception.", "Decades before the phrase ‘multi-media’ became a buzzword, this Christmas show stood as more than just a concert. It was simultaneously broadcast in stereo on BBC Radio 1 and on the BBC 2 television institution The Old Grey Whistle Test (the show’s host Bob Harris introduced the band on stage). Luckily, although the TV cameras were turned off before the band returned for their second encore, and consequently video footage of Seven Seas Of Rhye and See What A Fool I’ve Been doesn’t exist – the audio team did continue recording and so the CD and LP formats do feature the entire show.", "In 2015 this legendary show was finally given the pedestal it deserved, delivered in fitting style, featuring an incredible new audio mix in stereo and 5.1 surround-sound, plus a state-of-the-art restoration of the video. Featuring 15 tracks from their first four visionary albums, plus covers of four classic rock’n’roll staples delivered with characteristic panache, A Night At The Odeon captured a band in full flight and radiating megawatts of self-confidence.", "As well as audio and visual footage of the show, the DVD and SD Blu-Ray versions features two special bonus features – 'Looking Back At The Odeon’, a 22-minute documentary featuring a previously unseen interview with Brian and Roger with Old Grey Whistle Test presenter Bob Harris about the 1975 Hammersmith Odeon show, plus the rarely seen Live At The Budokan – Japan 1975 footage, featuring three songs recorded during their legendary tour of the Far East", "Says Bob Harris of this concert: “Christmas Eve 1975 marked an important moment in the history of the 'Old Grey Whistle Test' and Queen. The band were in party mood at the Hammersmith Odeon that night and no wonder. They had already spent the best part of a month at the top of the UK singles chart with the sensational 'Bohemian Rhapsody', the video for which had instantly redefined the presentation of music on TV. They were at the peak of their powers - confident and stage sharp at the end of a barnstorming UK tour. I donned top hat and tails to salute and introduce them before they played one of the best sets I had ever seen. It was an incredible night but it was more even than that.

Designed to dig a little deeper than their multi-million selling Greatest Hits compilations, Deep Cuts Volume 1 showcased a less familiar aspect of the early Queen story and reveals tracks to listeners looking to delve into the band’s formative years for the first time. Newer fans are exposed to the startling opening double hit of Orge Battle and Stone Cold Crazy, for example, and the tender Long Away led by Brian, as well as Roger’s cool Tenement Funster and the epic March Of The Black Queen from Freddie, amongst many other album track highlights."]
